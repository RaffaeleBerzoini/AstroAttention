portals using the fruit images and the instruction on the top of the screen to guide you. With each new phase, the challenges 
get tougher, but with the help of the handy tutorial robot, you'll have all the skills you need to succeed. At the end of the 
fourth phase, once you’ve received your score, it’s time to fill out the questionnaire. Ready to become the ultimate fruitcollecting champion of the universe?_
